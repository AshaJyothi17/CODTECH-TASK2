**Project Overview: Student Grade Tracker**
**Objective:**
The goal of the Student Grade Tracker project is to create a Python-based console application that allows users (teachers, students, or parents) to track and manage student grades for different subjects or assignments. It provides an intuitive interface to add, edit, delete, and display grades. The program also calculates the average grade, assigns a letter grade based on the average, and offers various grade management features.

**Features:**
Add Grades:
Users can input grades for different subjects or assignments. If a grade for the same subject already exists, it notifies the user to update it instead.

Edit Grades:
Allows users to update an existing grade for a specific subject. If the subject does not exist, the program will prompt the user to add it first.

Delete Grades:
Users can remove grades for a specific subject. If the subject does not exist, it provides feedback.

Display Grades:
The program shows a list of all subjects and their corresponding grades, along with the student's average grade and letter grade.

Exit:
The program gets Exited

**Conclusion:**
The Student Grade Tracker project is a practical Python application designed to simplify the process of managing and analyzing student grades. With its user-friendly command-line interface, the program allows users to easily add, edit, delete, and display grades, calculate averages, and assign letter grades based on a simple grading scale.
